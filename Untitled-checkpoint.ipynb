      "*AI: There's no single, easily defined \"total number of sections\" in Pakistani law.  Pakistan's legal system is vast and complex, encompassing numerous acts, ordinances, and regulations, each with its own sections.  These laws cover various aspects of life, from criminal law to contract law, family law, and more.\n",
      "\n",
      "To understand the scale, consider these points:\n",
      "\n",
      "* **Multiple Acts:**  Pakistan has hundreds of different Acts (laws passed by Parliament), each divided into sections.  For example, the Pakistan Penal Code (PPC) has many sections, as does the Code of Civil Procedure (CPC), the Code of Criminal Procedure (CrPC), and countless others dealing with specific areas like taxation, banking, etc.\n",
      "\n",
      "* **Ordinances:**  Ordinances are laws made by the President during times when Parliament isn't in session.  These also have their own sections.\n",
      "\n",
      "* **Regulations:** Various ministries and departments issue regulations to implement the Acts and Ordinances.  These too are divided into sections and subsections.\n",
      "\n",
      "Therefore, summing up the total number of sections across all these legal instruments is practically impossible without an exhaustive, manual count across all existing legislation, which would be a massive undertaking.  Each act is separately numbered and organized.  You would need to consult each individual act to determine its section count.\n",
      "*User: what section is charged on people which kill other person\n",
      "*AI: The section charged against a person who kills another person in Pakistan depends heavily on the circumstances of the killing.  There isn't one single section.  The Pakistan Penal Code (PPC) outlines various offenses related to homicide, each with its own section and punishment.  Here are some key sections:\n",
      "\n",
      "* **Section 302 (Murder):** This is the most serious charge, applicable when a person intentionally causes the death of another without any extenuating circumstances that might reduce the charge to manslaughter.  It carries the death penalty or life imprisonment.\n",
      "\n",
      "* **Section 304 (Culpable Homicide Not Amounting to Murder):** This section applies when the killing is intentional but lacks the premeditation or malice aforethought required for murder.  The punishment is less severe than murder.\n",
      "\n",
      "* **Section 304-A (Causing Death by Negligence):** This is applicable when someone's death results from another person's negligence or recklessness.  The punishment is significantly less severe than murder or culpable homicide.\n",
      "\n",
      "* **Section 304-B (Dowry Death):** This is a specific offense related to the death of a woman due to dowry-related harassment or cruelty.\n",
      "\n",
      "The specific section applied will depend on the prosecution's ability to prove the elements of the offense beyond a reasonable doubt.  A thorough investigation is crucial to determine which section best fits the facts of the case.  The court will consider factors such as intent, premeditation, the relationship between the accused and the victim, and any mitigating or aggravating circumstances.\n",
